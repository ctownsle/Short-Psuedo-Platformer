# Short-Psuedo-Platformer

Quick static camera "platformer" created using the Libgdx framework and Box2d for physics.

The basic story of this game comes from the enjoyment of difficulty found in precision platformers.

I wanted to do something along those lines, but only involving boss encounters, similar to some other games.

To start, I only have 1 boss fight written, and it is quite challenging considering the wonky physics.

## Notes

I intend to abstract the objects and entities, and use that framework to continue building the game.

I also intend to write my own physics for the game, because Box2d is fairly limiting if you want platforming to be precise. 

Also have to fix some platform textures that are behaving strangely.
